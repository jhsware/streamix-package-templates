# Streamix Graphics Package Templates

Streamix Panel is a graphics overlay software for the ATEM Mini series of video mixers. Graphics are created using packages that can be imported to your project.

There are three types of packages. They are all coded in the same way but differ in configuration:
- **graphics overlay:** used for graphics placed over the camera feed
- **fullscreen graphics overlay:** used for video playback or fullscreen graphics
- **stinger:** used for stinger transitions

Details about development is provided in the README.md of the created package.
